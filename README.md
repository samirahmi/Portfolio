## üëãüèª About Me
My name is **Rahmi Safitri**. As a Mechanical Engineering graduate, I transitioned into the IT field by joining an IT Bootcamp in October 2022. In January 2023, I began my career as a **Quality Assurance** (QA) Engineer. I am excited to have found a field where I can grow and develop my skills successfully.

Currently, I work as a **Performance Tester** in the banking industry in Indonesia. However, I aspire to expand my career in QA Engineering, exploring both **functional testing** (manual and automation) and **non-functional testing** (performance testing). To support this goal, I have started learning test automation with Katalon Studio and actively follow QA blogs to expand my knowledge. I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth in this field.
